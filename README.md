# Thorin-Games

**We recently lost the domain for the website, if we can not get it back, I do not know what will happen to the website**

Thorin-Games is a website that lets anybody play a wide selection of browser games for free **without any ads**.

The main focus for the website is to have a user friendly and intuitive interface that looks good. The website also aims at getting one of the largest collection of browser games in the future.

We are focused on the user and we give the users a lot of power over the website. The users rate, comment and submit games, and decides what other users are most likely to see. In a way, the users are the editors of the website.

#### This is a screenshot of how the website currently looks:

## Contributing
Our front end is open source and based on angularJS. Feel free to commit any changes you think will improve the website. If a commit changes the JavaScript code, then the shell script at `min/minify-all` must be run afterwards to update the minified JS files and make the changes available to the users. To run the script you need `npm` and `minifier` for npm.

Our back end is hosted by Google Drive and uses a Google Spreadsheet and Google Scripts. If you want to contribute to this code you would have to be invited first.
